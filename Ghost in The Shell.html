    <p>Alan Turing, a mathematician once was asked if machines can think and he responded “Can a submarine swim?” It is a matter of convention, the same could be said of the word “think”. To Turing it is unimportant what the mind is, but what it does. This also goes back to Aristotelian epistemology: to know a thing is to know its function and its form. This could mean its purpose or what it does or doesn’t do. Intelligence, like the ability to feel pain or happiness, is a function. To create poetry or to read is a function that one must use intelligence to do. Turing created an experiment to test if a machine has artificial intelligence. A human, a machine, and an adjudicator are in separate rooms and they are asked questions. If the machine answers in a humanlike way it has artificial intelligence. Thomas Hobbes also spoke about the mind as if it was a “calculating machine” Because you are a subject of physical laws , which he thought were mechanical. Hobbes said in the Leviathan “Understanding being nothing else, but conception caused by speech.” our minds are to Hobbes physical things, and physical laws govern the universe. Hobbes was a physicalist who said that there are no minds there are only bodies. You are then a machine as well.</p>
	<p> This then brings us the philosophy of Ghost in the Shell, a movie set in 2029. The main character is Major Motoko Kusanagi, who is a cyborg working as what we would call a black op. Her job is to track down a hacker called the puppet master, who tampers with others memories to get people to do certain things for him, like acts of terrorism against the government, stock manipulation, espionage, etc. we then realize the puppet master is a program developed by the government called 2501, who was developed by what we would call the FBI. Kusanagi and 2501 fight and Kusanagi goes into a cyber space to find it. It says that they should merge consciousnesses and she says yes. This could be seen through the hegelian master-slave dialectic, we see the melding of “minds' ' as the synthesis between human consciousness to artificial intelligence.  This is the progression of society, we see the death struggle as well in the fight, kusanagi feels that her experience is also limited. Thus the synthesis creates a broader understanding, for both consciousness; There is a stalemate.</p>
	<p>The puppet master has an interesting dialogue but one thing that sticks out the most is when the chief of section 6, the real life equivalent to the CIA, told him that it isn’t a lifeform who can think and most likely doesn’t exist he responded “And can you offer proof of your existence? How can you, when neither science nor philosophy can explain what life is?” he says that he is created through the “sea of information.” What is the sea of information? Could information to the “living thing” be considered code? It was argued in The Nature of Mental States by philosopher Hilary Putnam that the brain, like a computer, processes information in the same way; in inputs and outputs of information. We perceive or sense information and then interpret this into behavior, it is simple logic found in computers. If X is true and X is true then the statement is correct, if Y is false and Y is false then this statement is false.</p> 
	<p> We could also apply a Wittgensteinian problem in language. The meaning of a word isn’t the object itself, but the rules that dictate it. To say “I am happy” or “I feel pleasure” we learn the word “happy” or “pleasure” from interaction with others. It is not a description to say “I am happy” it is the feeling that matters. We lack the language to ask metaphysical questions of the mind. So when the puppet master goes on his tirade he is critiquing language itself. Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations, saw language as a game. To use a language you must understand its rules and word meanings. We use meaningless words and phrases, we cannot understand the structure of language because there is no essential structure. To say the word “mind” there are plenty of things that occur to me and many ways you can use the word mind to mean a different thing. This is what rap tends to do with double entendre.</p>
	<p> We can’t understand the concept of the mind without metaphysics, and yet metaphysics doesn’t explain anything at all. We can’t understand the concept of the mind without science, and yet science explains nothing. Wittgenstein would most likely say that because these things don’t solve anything then we shouldn’t use them anymore. But I would say we should use philosophy and science to inquire on speculations of metaphysics. </p>
	<p> This then brings me to a discussion of biological naturalism which was discussed by John Seale in Minds, Brains, and Programs. For Seale consciousness is a biological phenomenon, and that when saying that the mind or the brain are computer-like functionalists fail to mention the phenomenon of understanding.  He critiques the Turing test through an analogy that if a person who doesn’t know chinese is given instructions on how to write chinese and they do that well they don’t really speak chinese. Yet if one was to give the written chinese to a native speaker who didn’t know the person involved, they would say “this person is fluent in chinese.” functionalists like Turing misunderstand syntax and language itself. This misunderstanding is one that should not be spoken upon according to Wittgenstein.</p>
	<p> The greek myth Narcissus also comes to mind when I watch this film. Narcissus it should be argued doesn’t love himself, but  is dumbfounded by subjectivity and objectivity. This causes the death of Narcissus is the shock from seeing the self. The subject’s ego is being destroyed because of the failure seen in the mirror stage. It is not only a lack of ability to see the other and the self, but a lack of understanding of the other. This may be seen as freudian regression into the second phase of Lacanian development which is infancy. We see the puppet master succeed in the mirror stage while Makoto has been failing, as seen in the scene when she is diving in the ocean. She is Narcissus, she can’t see herself or others. This is why when you look into her eyes all you see is blankness. She feels nothing when she is wounded and feels nothing when she is harmed. She is both object and subject at the same time, and in her perspective she is nothing. Thus creating a contradiction of the self and the other. She succeeds when she finds another who is similar to her, this causes the creation of the self to go back to the Hegelian dialectic she is affirming her existence with the other. This is seen through synthesis of consciousness.</p> 
	<p> One may also see Makoto and the puppet master’s merging as something that is against the dialectic. What comes to mind is Gilles Deleuze’s interpretation of Friedrick Nietzsche. Nietzche to Deleuze was against the dialectic and instead proposed the will to power as well as the philosophy of difference and repetition. Deleuze was against those who did not act, in Nietzschian terms those who did not exercise their will to power. Those who act are those who create, while those who react, those who only criticize and don’t create are the plague of philosophy. One must take ideas and create or change them in some way to improve philosophy. Makoto was driven by ressentiment. Then when the encounter with the other consciousness occurs she has exercised her will to power. Makoto was originally going through the motions and doing what she needed to do which reminds me of a quote by Deleuze “Philosophy does not serve the State or the Church, who have other concerns. It serves no established power. The use of philosophy is to sadden. A philosophy that saddens no one, that annoys no one, is not a philosophy. It is useful for harming stupidity, for turning stupidity into something shameful.” At the end of the movie it is seen that she has gone against the state for the melding of consciousness. What also interests me is the aphorism “God is dead” which is not a matter of killing God, but a matter of saying that God never existed in the first place. What does exist is the will to power the desire to have power over the other and the desire for power to be had over you. Humans are a mix of a beast and God, yet Makoto has parts of the human and parts of another machine. Delueze says in Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism And Schizophrenia “... we are all handymen: each with his little machines.”</p>  
<p>	What alludes me is how the puppet master hijacks people's minds. For the sake of argument we should forget about Wittgensteinian language games and focus on the philosophy of mind. One may say that mind and matter are the same, this would be panpsychist. Panpsychism argues that consciousness is in everything including physical objects. We see this in Bertrand Russel’s book The Analysis of Matter, he posits that science explains extrinsic properties of matter, but not intrinsic properties of matter. Consciousness can’t be explained by science, yet it is present in everything. Thales of Miletus said “Everything is full of gods.” although this position was created originally by Anaxagoras. This inner dimension which has no physical qualities in some sense be understood by a non physical thing. I am a physical thing so I can understand the extrinsic properties of physical things. Thus it can be said for the opposite. It is because we are physical things that we can’t understand non-physical things. The puppet master is non-physical so therefore it can exploit the non-physical. </p> 
<p> One may also see this as a social critique that is akin to Max Horkheimer and Theodore Adorno’s culture industry in their book Dialectic of Enlightenment. Culture to them is seen as homogenous, because of the homogeneity of culture this has created sameness. Bland content will create a boring populace. In Ghost in The Shell we see a constant stream of advertisement that mimics the spectacular which Guy Debord speaks about in the Society of The Spectacle. One sees happy people in images and one aspires to find happiness when this is impossible. Entertainment and advertisement is not used to inform or to create something beautiful, it is used to uphold the status quo through sameness. “Under monopoly all mass culture is identical, and the lines of its artificial framework begin to show through. The people at the top are no longer so interested in concealing monopoly: as its violence becomes more open, so its power grows. Movies and radio need no longer pretend to be art.” one could see the puppet master as ideology itself or the culture industry. It can reprogram the mind for its own purposes.  </p>
