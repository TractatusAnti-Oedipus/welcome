    <title> On Capital and Ideology: A Critique of The Kentucky Cycle </title>

<p>After reading The Kentucky Cycle I am convinced that Shenkaan is one of the best bullshiters I’ve encountered in a while. In his work On Bullshit moral philosopher Harry Frankfurt creates a theory of bullshit. Bullshit is not lying, bullshit is described as “indifference to how things really are”, this is the essence of bullshit. The bullshitter can make a true statement but the liar makes only false statements. It is not a matter of telling the truth or not to the bullshitter, it is a matter of distortion of representation. Bullshit is more dangerous than lies are to Frankfurt. It is no secret that The Kentucky Cycle is riddled with historical inconsistencies, misrepresentation, and the omission of certain parts of history, which can be seen as bullshit, this brings me to the point of spectacle which is arguably a driving force of Bullshit and this book.</p> 
<p> Guy Debord said in the first proposition in The Society of the Spectacle  “In societies where modern conditions of productions prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.” The spectacular can be seen as a modern version of the marxian concept of commodity fetishism, that is to say that we give value to commodities that replace social concepts, groups, etc. this is one of the causes of bullshit. It is the false identification of signs and signifiers with objects themselves; it is distortion through simulacra, in other words these spectacles are more real than reality itself. The Kentucky Cycle has replaced history itself and turned it into a commodity, twisting for the interest of capital. The picture I decided to use was of people in a theater. You know I looked at this picture and I said to myself “Wow. This is the definition of a lonely crowd.” This crowd are those who consume the spectacular images of mythology. They are spectating.</p>
<p>Shennken’s Kentucky Cycle gives a feeling of catharsis to its viewers. They despise the company store and the audience sides with the union workers, there is a feeling of hope and excitement in rebellion. This act they are committing is seen as revolutionary praxis to the audience, but as Slovinian philosopher Slavoj Zizek once said in The Sublime Object of Ideology that anti-capitalism is propagated in and through capitalism. “If the concept of ideology is the classic one in which the illusion is located in knowledge” he states that “then today’s society must appear post-ideological: the prevailing ideology is that of cynicism; people no longer believe in ideological truth; they do not take ideological propositions seriously. The fundamental level of ideology, however, is not of an illusion masking the real state of things but that of an (unconscious) fantasy structuring our social reality itself. And at this level, we are of course far from being a post-ideological society. Cynical distance is just one way… to blind ourselves to the structural power of ideological fantasy: even if we don’t take things seriously, even if we keep an ironical distance, we are still doing them.” we fetishize commodities in our actions and yet we believe this is nonsense, this is ideology in the marxist sense. There will be no substantive critique of capitalism in the media because it isn't in the interest of media companies to do so. This builds upon the ideas of Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer in their book Dialectic of Enlightenment. Adorno and Horkheimer called culture in a capitalist society an “iron system”, and argued that culture under capitalism it is plagued by sameness and homogeneity. The only purpose of culture isn’t to create art or something that is beautiful or entertaining, its job is to perpetuate capitalist ideology. The play preforms our anti-capitalism for us so then we don’t partake in actual praxis. To add insult to injury we see as well that one can’t act violently against those in power, we see that when women take over the union they are pacifists. No capitalist in their right mind will give you income equality, or ethical working conditions, you must take it from their cold lifeless hands. Violence against one another in the book is seen as normal, but violence against capitalists is of limits. You can commit infanticide, be cruel, and rape people, but don’t you dare commit violence against the capitalsts. Which brings me to the picture “obedience to the law is freedom” which was said by the philosopher Boethius, then there was a spin put on it by Jean-Jaques Rousseau who said “liberty is obedience to the law which one has laid down for oneself.” The Kentucky Cycle isn’t a progressive play, it is merely another form of what French philosopher Gilles Deleuze would call “cybernetic control”. For Deleuze one isn’t able to recognize what is and isn’t propaganda under what he called societies of control, I will admit I have an issue with this as well at times. What one must realize is that in this post-modern era there is no choice in homogeny, there is only consumption of fetishized commodities, mythology, signs, and spectacle. </p>
<p>With my next picture we see gears, the “cold machine” as Adorno and Horkheimer call it. The desire to be subjected, to partake in your peoples own agony and pain is rather dark. To end my presentation I would like to quote Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guittari from Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism And Schizophrenia “it is at work everywhere, functioning smoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it hears, it eats. It shits and fucks. What a mistake to have ever said the id. Everywhere it is machines- real ones, not figurative ones: machines driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary couplings and connections...we are all handymen: each with his little machines.” our little machines assist the capitalist machine though our disavow. There is an ideological messaging underneath the surface. It is: “don’t think, don’t politicize, forget about the causes of suffering, just by the tickets so you can feel good about yourself and show people back home that you are classy because you went to a broadway show.”
