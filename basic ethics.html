    <h2>basic ethics</h2>
          <p>Free will:</p>
<p>Free will: being able to act rightly or wrongly
An action can be considered morally justifiable if an agent has made a rational choice to act according to a moral principle 
Moral agency requires rationality, nonrational actions are not moral actions. This is why young children are not moral agents because they lack rationality. 
Some may say that free will and rationality are aspects of morality.
Philosophers question whether adults are moral agents .
Determinism: the world is governed by laws of nature. This means that our actions and behaviors are governed by these laws. So there is no such thing as free will.
If we cannot have the ability to think rationally or don’t have free will then how can we act morally? 
        Thus the determinist may say that morality doesn’t exists. </p>
<p>
    The fact-value distinction:</p>
          <p>
David Hume argues we can’t arrive at a value from a fact because values depend on what matters to us.
Some philosophers think that the key characteristic of  value judgments is that we cannot construct arguments for or against them. 
They possess deeply held convictions. 
If we don’t value something then it is difficult to persuade someone to value something. 
Judgments about values are different from judgements about facts.
David hume made a distinction between “is” (facts) and “ought” (statments that express what matters to individuals).
People tend to blur the line between facts and values 
Any attempt to bridge the gap between is and ought statements involve assumptions on what matters.
Are moral statements absolutely true or relatively true?

          Aristotle’s virtue ethics:</p>
          <p>
Aristotle’s theory is called “virtue ethics”.
A virtuous person to Aristotle is one who knows what is right, does what is right, and does what is right, and does what is right for the right reasons.
Our capacity for reason separates us from others.
Only humans can be virtuous.
The function and purpose of humankind is to exercise reason in action.
 To be reasonable is to exercise virtue.
The only way to live a pleasurable life or as Aristotle would say to live in eudaimonia is to act virtuously.
Eudaimonia means “happiness” or “flourishing”.
If we make the right choices for the right reasons then we will acquire virtue.
You can get better at being moral, it is a skill. 
To be virtuous means we must understand ourselves. 
We must also find a “golden mean” as Aristotle puts it, that is the action that avoids being excessive or being defiant.
For an example if you are too courageous you can act stupidly or if you're not courageous enough you act cowardly.

          Humean ethics:</p>
<p>David Hume was an advocate for non-cognitivism: the view that morality is not a matter of reason and that, therefore, moral statements can’t be true or false.
Cognitive states such as beliefs and knowledge can’t motivate actions.
Actions are motivated instead by “passions” such as desire, emotion, and value. 
Only passion motivates us. 
It is passion that prompts us to act and not moral judgement. 
Moral judgements express passion. 
“Reason is, and out only to be, the slave of the passions” Hume, A Treatise of Human Human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
          Deontology:</p> 
<p>Deontology comes from the Greek word for “obligation”. 
Morality is based on unbreakable rules.
Immanuel Kant said that all our actions are done either to achieve a desired result or out of a sense of moral duty.
Acts motivated by passion cannot be moral. 
An act can only be good if the person puts their own inclinations aside and performs it out of duty. 
 Our actions are moral as long as our intentions are good. 
Each deontologist has their own moral law. For Kant it was “the categorical imperative”.
Imperatives are kind of like instructions.
For Kant there are 2 imperatives: the categorical imperative and the hypothetical imperative.
The hypothetical imperative tells us how to act in order to achieve a desired goal.
The categorical imperative applies to everyone regardless of individual desires or circumstances.
In acting out a moral duty, a person is acting on a categorical imperative.

          Utilitarianism:</p> 
<p>Utilitarians say the right action is the one that causes the greatest happiness of the greatest number (GHGN).
The right action is one with the most desirable outcomes. 
The only thing that we desire is happiness.
Happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain,
Unhappiness is pain and the absence of pleasure.  
We need a rule that can be applied to all situations. 
This rule is the greatest happiness principle (GHP) stating:
An action is only right when it results in GHGN.
If we intend to or not to increase the GHGN it doesn’t matter.
      </p>

          Existentialist ethics:</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Sartre’s existentialism denies the existence of God and human nature.
We have no essence: characteristics that make us what we are.
There is no divine purpose that defines us or determines how we act.
There is no non-divine purpose or rules either.
We must reduce bad faith: self- deceit about our freedom to transcend the identities imposed upon us by others or by ourself.
We become who we are because of the choices we make.
Only we are able to surpass ourselves, to transcend what we are, and to become what we choose to become.
The need to make responsible choices weighs heavily on us. That is because we feel abandoned in the universe.
We are “condemned to be free.”
