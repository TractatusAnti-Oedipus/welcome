    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kolya and I like philosophy, my specialty is continental philosophy, but I also enjoy analytical. My main focus in continental philosophy is political philosophy, specifically understanding power relations, methods of control, and ideology, which I try to incorporate into cinema or pop cultural phenomena. When discussing Ideology I tend to take a post-structural stance that aligns with Jaques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. My greatest influences on my philosophy and in life are: Jaques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Ludwig Wittgenstien, Sigmund Freud, Jean Bauldrillard and Slavoj Zizek. </p>
